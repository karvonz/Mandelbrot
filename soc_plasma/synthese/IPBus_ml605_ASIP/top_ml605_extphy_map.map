ERROR:Pack:2744 - This design requires at least 4830 SLICEMs for LUTRAMs. The target device has only 4750 SLICEM sites. Please modify the
   logical design source to reduce the number of LUTRAMs. 
   As an alternative, please select a device with more SLICEM sites.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       45,648
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        43,340 out of  45,648   94%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
