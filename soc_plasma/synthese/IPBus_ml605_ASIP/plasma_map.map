Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   891 out of  11,200    7%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,395
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,782 out of   3,395   52%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              11 out of  44,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

    Number using BlockRAM only:                  8
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:               8
    Total Memory used (KB):                    288 out of   5,328    5%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
